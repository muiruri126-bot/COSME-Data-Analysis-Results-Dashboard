# 13. THEORY OF CHANGE & IMPACT EVIDENCE

## 13.1 Theory of Change Evidence Pathways
Three intermediate outcomes validated:
1. **1100 — NbS Adoption**: Community adoption of nature-based solutions
2. **1200 — Women's Agency**: Women's economic empowerment, decision-making, resource access
3. **1300 — Governance**: Institutional and governance structures supporting gender-responsive NbS

## 13.2 Endline Projections (3 scenarios)

| Scenario | Assumption | Projection |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| Maintained | Current trajectory | 50% of midline gains maintained |
| Accelerated | Intensified programming | 80% achievement of all targets |
| Regression | Program disruption | 20% loss from midline values |

## 13.3 Methodology Notes
- ToC framework used for cross-outcome validation
- Projection model based on baseline-midline trajectory
- Data sources: Household surveys, group assessments, training records, school evaluations
- Limitations acknowledged: Self-reported data, seasonal variation, attribution challenges
- Tension detection: Social norms data (women's J1/J2) shows concerning increases requiring investigation
